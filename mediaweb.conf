# Resize images before providing them to the client. The
# resized images are cached in the same location as the
# thumbnails. 
#
# The advantages are:
#  1. Lower network bandwith required
#  2. Smoother navigation at the client. Particular if
#     browsing the images using a mobile client.
# 
# Disadvantages are:
#  1. Slower response time to view the image first time
#     since resizing image might take several seconds.
#  2. Increased cache storage required. 
#
# Previews are default off.

# be resized so that width and hight is not larger than
